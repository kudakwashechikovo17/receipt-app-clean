# Earthsafe Management System Receipt Management System with AI Text Extraction

I created Earthsafe Management System Receipt Management System tht uses Amazon AI Text Extraction, application that allows users to upload receipt images and extract text using Amazon Textract AI. Built with React and AWS Amplify.

## The Main Features
This app lets you upload receipt images, automatically extract text using AI (Amazon Textract), search and filter by content or status, sort results, delete receipts, and view real-time updates â€” all from a responsive, user-friendly dashboard.


## ðŸ›  Technology Stack

- Frontend React 18, AWS Amplify UI Components
- Backend AWS Amplify (GraphQL API, DynamoDB)
- Storage Amazon S3
- AI Processing Amazon Textract
- Authentication: AWS Cognito
- Deployment Docker, Nginx




## Docker Deployment
 Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t <dockerhub-username>/receipt-app:v1 .
```

### Test Locally
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 <dockerhub-username>/receipt-app:v1
curl http://localhost:8080
```

### Push to Docker Hub
```bash
docker login
docker push <dockerhub-username>/receipt-app:v1
```


### Deploy on Web Servers
```bash
# On web-01 and web-02
docker pull <dockerhub-username>/receipt-app:v1
docker run -d --name receipt-app --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 <dockerhub-username>/receipt-app:v1
```

### Configure Load Balancer (HAProxy)
Update `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`:
```
backend webapps
    balance roundrobin
    server web01 172.20.0.11:8080 check
    server web02 172.20.0.12:8080 check
```

Reload HAProxy:
```bash
docker exec -it lb-01 sh -c 'haproxy -sf $(pidof haproxy) -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg'
```

 API Integration

### Amazon Textract
 Extract text from receipt images
AWS Textract DetectDocumentText API
~$0.0015 per page processed [AWS Textract Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/)

### AWS Amplify GraphQL API
- Purpose: Store receipt metadata and extracted text
- Authentication: AWS Cognito User Pools
- Database: Amazon DynamoDB

##  User Interaction Features

 Upload & Process
   - Drag & drop or click to upload
   - File validation (type, size)
   - Real-time processing status


Once your receipt is processed, you can easily view the extracted text along with confidence scores, delete anything you donâ€™t need, and enjoy automatic updates every few seconds â€” no need to refresh manually.

User authentication is handled through AWS Cognito, API keys are kept safe and out of the codebase, all inputs are sanitized, and HTTPS is enforced with secure headers configured in Nginx â€” so your data stays protected at every step.

The app is built to handle real-world hiccups like network drops, upload failures, API rate limits, invalid file formats, and even authentication issues â€” so you stay informed without getting stuck.
